The project is made by Petrescu Eugen Mihai starting the project and implementing the libraries and function. The contribution from  Cimponerescu Siarra is focused on adding the variables for the growth rate and death rate of both species and starting the showcase of the plots of both species. The contribution for Jasmine Gibson is finishing the graphic implementation and properly running and testing it.
This program simulates the interaction between a fish population and a bear population using a mathematical predator–prey model. The simulation is based on the Lotka–Volterra equations, which describe how prey grow naturally while predators depend on prey for survival. Population sizes are measured in hundreds, and the model shows how both populations change over time due to growth, predation, and natural death.

The mathematical model uses two differential equations: one for the fish population and one for the bear population. Fish increase at a natural growth rate but decrease when they are eaten by bears. Bears increase when food is available (fish) and decrease due to natural mortality. These coupled equations create oscillating population dynamics that are typical of predator–prey systems.
In order to run the code you need to have Python 3 installed and the required libraries, such as numpy, matplotlib and scipy. The program uses a numerical solver to integrate the equations over time and produce two plots one showing the fish population and one showinng the bear population as functions of time. Numpy is used for numerical operations, scipy for solving differential equations and matplotlib for showing the results.
